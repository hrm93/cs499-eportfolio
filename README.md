## üö© Project Overview

This project enhances an existing GIS automation tool initially built as a final project for the **IT 338: Geospatial Programming** course. The tool was designed to assist with spatial exclusion analysis by buffering human-made features and identifying safe zones within park boundaries. The original version relied on **ArcGIS Pro and ArcPy**, which limited portability, accessibility, and long-term maintainability. The primary objective is to automate geospatial processing tasks and enhance the tool‚Äôs scalability across diverse use cases.  

This enhanced GIS Pipeline Tool builds upon a final project originally developed for **IT 338: Geospatial Programming**. Initially built using ArcGIS Pro and ArcPy, the tool has been modernized to support open-source geospatial workflows. It enables scalable spatial exclusion analysis through buffer processing and integrates a flexible CLI, parallelism, and optional MongoDB logging.

This tool is designed for GIS professionals, data engineers, and developers seeking a scalable, Python-based solution for spatial data processing.

## üíæ MongoDB Integration  
MongoDB support is optional and provides a way to store spatial metadata and processing logs for auditing and analysis.
#### To enable MongoDB functionality:
- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.  
- Configure connection parameters (e.g., URI, database name) in config.py or via environment variables.  
- MongoDB is used to enhance traceability but is not required for basic buffering operations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
### Windows pytest PermissionError during cleanup
When running tests with pytest on Windows, you might occasionally see a warning like:

```
Exception ignored in atexit callback: <function cleanup_numbered_dir at 0x...>
PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: 'C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pytest-of-user\\pytest-current'
```
This happens because Windows sometimes restricts deletion of temporary test directories during cleanup.

### Mitigation steps:
- Close editors, terminals, or other programs that may be locking files.
- Run pytest with Administrator privileges.
- Manually delete the pytest temp folders under your Windows temp directory:  
`C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Local\Temp\pytest-of-<username>\`
- Temporarily disable antivirus or Windows Defender which may lock files.
- Use pytest‚Äôs --basetemp option to specify a custom temp directory, e.g.:
  `pytest --basetemp=./.pytest_tmp`

You can safely ignore this warning if it does not affect your tests passing.
