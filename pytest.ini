# ----------------------------------------------
# Warning Filters Explanation and Mitigation
#
# These filters suppress specific warnings encountered during test runs.
# They are applied to maintain clean test output and focus on actionable issues.
#
# 1. UserWarning:geopandas.io.file
#    - Warning occurs when writing empty GeoDataFrames to files.
#    - This is common during tests with empty inputs.
#    - Safe to ignore as tests explicitly handle empty data cases.
#
# 2. DeprecationWarning:pyproj.transformer
#    - Raised by pyproj due to upcoming changes in NumPy scalar handling.
#    - Pyproj maintainers are expected to address this in future releases.
#    - No immediate impact on functionality; safe to suppress temporarily.
#
# 3. DeprecationWarning:geopandas._compat
#    - Raised by GeoPandas importing deprecated 'shapely.geos' namespace.
#    - Shapely 2.0 changed API; GeoPandas will update in future releases.
#    - This warning is filtered until dependent libraries update.
#
# 4. UserWarning:You are attempting to write an empty DataFrame to file.
#    - Indicates GeoPandas/Fiona may have trouble writing empty spatial files.
#    - Tests ensure empty cases are handled properly; warning is harmless.
#
# Mitigation Strategy:
# - Regularly update dependencies (GeoPandas, Shapely, Pyproj) to latest versions.
# - Review changelogs for breaking API changes.
# - Refactor code when new versions remove deprecated APIs.
# - Revisit warning filters periodically to remove obsolete ones.
#
# Suppressing these warnings is a pragmatic choice to reduce noise while maintaining
# test reliability and focusing on meaningful issues.
